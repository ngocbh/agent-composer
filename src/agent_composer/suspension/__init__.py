"""Durable suspend/resume machinery.

A node that awaits something (a person, an external event) emits `PauseRequested`
carrying a typed `PauseReason`. The engine parks that node, records it, and the
run can be serialized to a `RunCheckpoint`. The host satisfies the pause by
delivering the awaited value as the parked leaf's `Output` via a
`DeliverAnswerCommand` and re-invoking `resume()` on the live engine.
