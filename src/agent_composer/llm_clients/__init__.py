"""LLM client wrappers + the per-AGENT `LLMConfig` — agent_composer's model seam.

The single place the engine reaches a chat model: `LLMConfig` (the selection
carrier) and `model_from_config` (resolve it to a ready `BaseChatModel`), plus the
per-provider client wrappers behind `create_llm_client`. The AGENT node and the
Compose loader's `llm_config:` field draw on this; `chat/` and `cli/` use it too.

Knows about:   the package env-based defaults (`_settings`), langchain, provider SDKs.
Never imports: any other agent_composer subpackage — it is a leaf (peer of state /
               events), so nodes/compose/runtime may import it, never the reverse.
