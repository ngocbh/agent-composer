"""Every shipped example must load and compile (no live LLM).

These guard the `examples/` gallery against drift: a flow that no longer parses,
references an unknown node, or breaks a binding fails here. AGENT examples need a
provider to *run*, so we only assert they LOAD — the engine boundary is exercised
by the CODE-flow CLI tests and the engine suite.
