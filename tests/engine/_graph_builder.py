"""Manual-graph helper: build a CompiledFlow from (from, to[, handle]) edge tuples,
injecting real StartNode/EndNode objects so the ~12 direct-construction test files keep working
once the __start__/__end__ sentinel guards retire (the boundary becomes ordinary NODES).

Mirrors the existing test_engine.py manual-graph convention (Edge per tuple + derive_wiring);
the additions are the StartNode/EndNode node objects under START_ID/END_ID. When the caller
declares `outputs`, the END_ID node is built RECORD-mode (one param per output) and its producer
edges are minted from the output bindings (the loader's emit_for shape) so the engine reads the
declared-output value as `store[END_ID]` — the manual `(x, END_ID)` tuples are then dropped
(superseded by the minted producer edges). With no `outputs`, END_ID is output-less (returns None)
and the manual `(x, END_ID)` tuples stand as bare adjacencies.
