"""Splice baseline (characterization, GREEN on first run).

Pins the child START_ID/END_ID shape the splice keys off, so the splice can assert its deltas
against recorded literals (not a remembered set). Loads a one-output REF parent + a CODE-only
child and a MAP parent WITHOUT running them, recording the boundary-node shape (the child
START_ID's params == declared input names; the child END_ID's params == declared output names; START_ID
is the single root; END_ID is the terminal) + the parent edge id set + the CALL/MAP wiring.

No OUTPUT_RESOLVER/COLLECTOR kind is reachable from a LOADED (un-run) flow — synthesis removed them;
they only appear at RUNTIME.
