"""Compact (single-node) flows: a flow whose top-level body carries a node `kind:`
and no `nodes:` map. The parser desugars it into the canonical one-node flow before
compile (so the IR + engine are unchanged):

- the flow `id:` names the single node;
- the flow `input:` is the node signature, auto-wired by name (`p = ${input.p}`);
- the flow `output:` is the node's output TYPE, re-exported as the flow output;
- every other top-level key is the node body (kind + its logic fields).

Run tests use the `code` kind (Ollama-free); parser tests cover the desugar shape
and the rejections (non-leaf kind, missing id).
