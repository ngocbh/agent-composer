"""Structural purity: NO Node attribute holds a `${...}` SOURCE.

The headline payoff of the wiring relocation: `CompiledFlow.wiring` is the
SOLE owner of input *bindable* sources. A node carries only its signature (`params`) + its logic
— an AGENT prompt / IF_ELSE `when` reference bare `${param}` names, never a pool ref. This walks
every representative seed's nodes (recursing into baked `call`/`map` child flows) and asserts no
node-held string is a pool-ref source (`${outputs|inputs|system|item ...}`); a stray leaf source
or a `WaitNode.until` left on a node would trip it. Sources live only on `flow.wiring` (and the
flow-level `outputs:`), never on a `Node`.

No exemptions: the MAP re-split retired the last one (the old `CallNode.over` discriminator).
`MapNode` discriminates by KIND, not an `over` source string — the `over:` source rides
`flow.wiring[id]["over"]` alone, so the scan passes cleanly with no node-held source anywhere.
