"""Golden baselines (a *characterization* test).

Pins the current edge-id sets of representative flows so the wiring relocation (wiring moves
off the node onto `CompiledFlow.wiring`, edges become its derived projection) can prove
**byte-identical edge ids / no drift** against a recorded baseline rather than a remembered
one.

This is GREEN on first run by construction. If a later change legitimately changes the
topology, update the literals here in the same commit and explain why.

Coverage across the three seeds: data edges, IF_ELSE/case control edges + skip-flood targets,
synthesized root (`__start__->`) + terminal (`->__end__#0`) edges, the ordering separator (`~>`),
and a mapped `call` (MAP) node. REF/MAP child-message byte-identity is guarded by the existing
lock-in tests (test_ref_run / test_map / test_ref_map); the format constants are recorded here for
the lock-in that re-homes the MAP `over`-not-a-list message into the engine bind seam.
