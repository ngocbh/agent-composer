"""A `call` node's node-local POST `asserts:` must fire — at the alias-commit site.

A `call` is a spawner: it yields an `Enqueue` (eval_node returns BEFORE the post-assert
block), and its `${output}` is committed LATER, in `engine._on_success`'s alias branch when
the cloned child's END filler finishes. So the call's `${output}` post-asserts can ONLY run
there; eval_node's post-assert block never sees them. Before the fix they were silently
dropped — a false one passed quietly, violating "a false assert fails the run loudly".

These pin: a true call post-assert passes, a false one fails the run LOUDLY (RunFailed,
error_type "NodeAssertFailed", a non-null locator at the assert), a post-assert reading BOTH
a declared call input AND `${output}` fires correctly, and (durability) the input record the
assert reads is recovered from the persisted `CallExpansion.record` after a checkpoint
round-trip — no new checkpoint field.
