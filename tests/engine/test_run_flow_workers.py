"""`run_flow(num_workers=N)` threads the engine drive mode through from the compose layer.

A fan-out/fan-in code flow (Ollama-free) is run serial (`0`) and pooled (`>=1`); the
terminal output must be identical — workers are pure executors, so the result is
worker-count-independent (only intra-run concurrency changes).
