"""build_loop_node + loader dispatch + the `'a -> 'a` shape contract.

A `kind: loop` node bakes a `LoopNode` from a `LoopDescriptor`: it resolves+bakes the
body subflow (the `call:` child, a `defs:` callable here so no external resolver is
needed), stamps `output_shape`, and enforces the two halves of the shape contract:

- FIELD-NAME-set (in `build_loop_node`): body output field NAMES == carried keys,
  body input NAMES subset of carried keys — a located `LoadError` on a name mismatch.
- FULL TYPE equality (in the loader post-build pass `check_loop_shape_contract`):
  body output Shape == carried record Shape per field — a located `LoadError` on a
  same-names/different-TYPES mismatch (needs the assembled producers/flow-input shapes).
