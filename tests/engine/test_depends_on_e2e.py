"""Feature D end-to-end (Ollama-free): depends_on (co-skip) vs runs_after (pure order).

A CODE-bodied flow where a side-effect `warm` node sits behind a `case`, so it can be
skipped. Two downstream nodes carry NO data from `warm`, only an ordering edge:

- `dep_fetch` — `depends_on: [warm]`  -> co-skips when `warm` is skipped.
- `after_fetch` — `runs_after: [warm]` -> still runs when `warm` is skipped.

Both run when `warm` runs (the ordering edge is just satisfied). The flow output
coalesces the two, so whichever survived is the terminal value.
